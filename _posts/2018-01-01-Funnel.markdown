description: >
  I designed this funnel to allow faster and cleaner oil changes for my Subaru cars. It threads on to the filler neck of any EJ engine, and I also have a tall version that fits the new FA / FB engines.
  The new one needs to be taller to clear the top mounted oil filter.
  
  
  It also includes a thread on cap, which acts as a stand. So you can set it on your shelf and it won't spill oil everywhere.
