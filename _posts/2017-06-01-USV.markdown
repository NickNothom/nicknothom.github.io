  This is a 1 meter long, electric catamaran. In the marine robotics industry this is referred to as a USV (Unmanned Surface Vessel). It uses two [Blue Robotics](http://www.bluerobotics.com/) underwater thrusters for propulsion
  
  
  The hulls are made of 3 pieces. An HDPE deck, an HDPE inner wall, and EPS foam buoyancy material. The deck and inner walls are CNC machined, the foam was hand carved with a hot wire. It has 20 pounds of thrust, and can run for over 8 hours. 
  
  
  The firmware is ArduRover, running on a Pixhawk. It's capable of autonomous navigation. It can carry sonar sensors, water chemistry sensors and samplers, cameras, etc..
