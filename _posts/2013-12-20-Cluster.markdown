  In 2013 I was teaching myself CAD in 3DS Max. Mainly to play with designing cars and other vehicles. I wanted to be able to create photorealistic renders, but they were taking nearly 8 hours per frame on the computer I had. 
  I was able to acquire 15 Dell Optiplex machines and a gigabit network switch and connect them all together. From there I used VRay's build in master-slave rendering solution to get running on my project. For renders over 10 mintues, they were significantly faster running on this cluster.
  The most difficult part of this was getting all of the data between each of the machines.
  
  
  As I started to learn more about software I installed Linux on all of them and started experimenting with large scale calculations. I learned a lot by doing this, but didn't ultimately apply it to anything. Cloud computing has become so simple and inexpensive that there's little reason to do something like this.
