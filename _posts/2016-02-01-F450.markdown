description: >
  The goal of this project was to learn about robotic development by building my own multirotor.
  One of the main goals of the project was autonomous flight, from takeoff to landing. 
  

  For firmware, I chose to use ArduCopter as it already supported all of these features. 
  For a list of hardware, see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mEt1_eJSIiduIqlckn3DclfPrjCSxVvRpn57FSve-7M/edit?usp=sharing).

  Onboard Electronics:

  1. Pixhawk

  2. 5.8ghz video transmitter

  3. Barometric altitude sensor

  4. GPS

  5. Compass

  6. Downward facing ultrasound

  7. 915mhz telemetry radio

  Overall, the build achieved an excellent mix of results with acrobatic abilities, autonomous flight, stability in high winds, and portability.
