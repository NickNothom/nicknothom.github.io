  This small 4WD rover was created based on Nik Ivanov's [Watney](https://github.com/nikivanov/watney). 
  
  The software was modified to allow remote control through my VPS. 
  
  I also added a night vision camera and some infrared LEDs which are controllable from a MOSFET. It runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and is powered from a portable battery bank. The battery life is approximately 3 days.
