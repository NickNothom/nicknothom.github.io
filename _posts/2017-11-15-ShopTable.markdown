  I needed a sturdy work table for my lab, but I also wanted it to look good. I designed this in Fusion 360 and used a lot of materials I already had laying around. 
  
  
  
  The top and shelf piece are MDF, and the rest of it is just stud wood. The casters are from Home Depot. I spent about $120 to make it, and it took about 8 hours start to finish.
