  I restored this early 1980s Jawa over the course of a couple years. It was pretty fun to work on because I think it may actually be the simplest internal combustion engine ever built. 
  The engine is the size of a toaster and it's so small that something like head resurfacing can be done by hand. I eventually ended up tearing the motor down to replace the crankshaft bearings and all the seals. 
  It never runs right, but it always runs.
