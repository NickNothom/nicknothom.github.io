description: >
  I designed and built a removable thruster module for small personal watercraft. The main board and keels were routed out of HDPE, then smoothed for better hydrodynamics. It has several mounting slots for fitting to different vehicles.
  
  
  
  The keels provide mounting locations for the two Blue Robotics M200 motors. A single cable bundle runs into a waterproof case which serves as the Power + Electronics + Control box. 
  
  
  
  Two Blue Robotics Lithium Ion batteries power the vehicle, which should allow it to cruise all day. The controls are done with a Blue Robotics Thruster Commander, which provides two potentiometers that are used for speed and steering controls. I plan to add remote control as well.
