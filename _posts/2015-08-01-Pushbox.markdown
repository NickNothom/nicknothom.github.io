  This is Pushbox, my first IOT project. It's a smart power strip that's controlled by an Android app, Android Wear, and a website. It uses NodeJS and tunnels outward to a management server so there is no router reconfiguration required. Response times from a click in the app to the relay actuation are about 40ms. 


  It's currently automated to turn on my lights one minute before my alarms go off, so I can wake up naturally. It also automatically turns off my lights, fan, and electronic candle when I leave, and turns on an air purifier. When I get home, the air purifier is turned off and the lights turn on. 
  
  
  Everything can be controlled through Google Assistant by voice.
